# SMS-Spam-detection
In todayâ€™s society, practically everyone has a mobile phone, and they all get communications (SMS/ email) on their phone regularly. But the essential point is that majority of the messages received will be spam, with only a few being ham or necessary communications. Scammers create fraudulent text messages to deceive you into giving them your personal information, such as your password, account number, or Social Security number. If they have such information, they may be able to gain access to your email, bank, or other accounts.
In this project, I am going to develop various deep learning models using Tensorflow for SMS spam detection and also analyze the performance metrics of different models.
