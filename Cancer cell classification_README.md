# Cancer Detector
Classification of cancer cells based on their features, and identifying if they are ‘malignant’ or ‘benign’. We will be using sci-kit-learn for a machine-learning problem. Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning, data mining, and data analysis library for Python programming language.
# The dataset: 
Scikit-learn comes with a few small standard datasets that do not require downloading any file from any external website. The dataset that we will be using for our machine learning problem is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset. The dataset includes several data about breast cancer tumors along with the classifications labels, viz., malignant or benign. It can be loaded using the following function: 
## load_breast_cancer([return_X_y])
The data set has 569 instances or data of 569 tumors and includes data on 30 attributes or features like the radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc. of a tumor. We will be using these features to train our model.
